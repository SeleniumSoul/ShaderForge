hey everyone~

I will occasionally update this repository with fixes and features!
I'll mostly do compatibility updates for future versions of Unity whenever I need it. if you want older versions, consider pulling one of the older branches! I'll try to name branches helpfully. the oldest version of SF you can get is for Unity 5.x

also, please don't pressure me into doing or fixing things because holy heck I was burnt out at the end of Shader Forge's first lifetime 👀 I'm mostly working on this casually, either when I need a fix or a new feature, or when I have time to fix something other people really want to see fixed!

also, if you enjoy or are currently enjoying or finding Shader Forge useful, please consider supporting me, if you're able to!

you can either do a one-time donation on PayPal at https://www.paypal.me/acegikmo ✨

or a monthly donation on Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/acegikmo 💖

support is entirely optional though, I intend to keep this project open and free, but if you do donate, thank you so hecking much!! if you want to reach me, Twitter is the best place https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer 🐦

If you finish and release a product using Shader Forge, I would appreciate a mention of Shader Forge in the credits :)


Selling shaders created in Shader Forge:
----------------------------------------
Shaders created in SF can be used freely in commercial and non-commercial projects with no restrictions.
If you are creating assets for the asset store using SF shaders, people will probably want to know if the shaders are created with Shader Forge,
so they know they can easily be modified!
I would also be super happy if you were to credit SF in the asset store description,
linked to either the website http://www.acegikmo.com/shaderforge/ or the asset store page http://u3d.as/6cc :)
